# raindrop (rdrop)

[English](README.md) | [ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](README.zh-CN.md)

**raindrop** is an extremely simple and user-friendly command-line tool designed to help you instantly share files, text messages, or plain content within a local area network (LAN). It's ideal for temporary or point-to-point data exchange scenarios.

The following sharing modes are supported and can be flexibly combined:

* üìÅ **File Sharing**: Share any number of files that recipients can directly download via their browser.
* üìÑ **Plain Text Sharing**: Display the contents of `.txt`, `.md`, `.log`, and other text files directly in the browser without downloading.
* üí¨ **Message Sending**: Send a short text message.

This tool is developed in Go, zero-config, lightweight, and cross-platform. It runs with just a standalone binary.

## ‚úø Why is it called *raindrop*?

The name is inspired by IU's song **"Rain Drop"**.

Note: For convenience, the command-line tool is named `rdrop`. Use `rdrop` to execute related commands.

## üì¶ How to Install?

This project provides a [`justfile`](https://github.com/casey/just) to simplify common operations.

### Method 1: Using `just` (if installed)

```bash
just tidy     # Tidy up dependencies
just build    # Build to ./release/rdrop
```

### Method 2: Using Go commands

```bash
go mod tidy
go build -o ./release/rdrop
```

## ü§Ø How to Use?

Once started, raindrop runs a temporary HTTP server on your device (default port is `1130`). Simply open the URL shown in your terminal from any other device (phone, tablet, PC) on the same LAN to access the shared content.

Directly follow the command with the paths to files or folders to be shared. You can share one or more files or directories.

```bash
rdrop iu.txt iu.png iu_folder/
```

**Send a message**
Send a plain text message using the `-m` or `--message` option.

```bash
rdrop -m "Here's a video link: https://youtu.be/xgXFCOoQJVc"
```

**Send file content**
Use the `-c` or `--content-file` option to send the content of a specified file as plain text.

```bash
rdrop -c iu_wiki.md
```

**Specify server port** (default 1130)
Use the `-p` or `--port` option to set the server's listening port.

```bash
rdrop -p 1993 -m "Love my IU"
```

**Combine all options**
All options can be used together to accommodate more complex needs.

```bash
rdrop iu_folder/ -m "Hi! These are today's IU reports" -c iu_wiki.md -p 1993
```
