# raindrop (rdrop)

[English](README.md) | [ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](README.zh-CN.md)

raindrop is an ultra-simple and easy-to-use command-line tool designed to help you instantly share files, text messages, or plain text content over your local network. It‚Äôs perfect for quick, temporary, or peer-to-peer data exchanges.

It supports several sharing modes, which you can combine freely:

* üìÅ **File Sharing**: Share any single file, allowing recipients to download it directly via their browser.
* üìÑ **Plain Text Sharing**: Display the content of text files like `.txt`, `.md`, or `.log` directly in the recipient‚Äôs browser without requiring a download.
* üí¨ **Message Sending**: Send a short text message.

This tool is developed in Go, requiring zero configuration, lightweight and efficient, and runs cross-platform with just a single standalone binary.

## ‚úø Why is it called raindrop?

The name is inspired by IU's song *Rain Drop*.

## üì¶ How to Install?

This project includes a [`justfile`](https://github.com/casey/just) to simplify common tasks.

### Method 1: Using just (if already installed)

```bash
just tidy     # tidy up dependencies
just build    # builds to ./release/rdrop
```

### Method 2: Using Go commands

```bash
go mod tidy
go build -o ./release/rdrop
```

## ü§Ø How to Use?

When launched, raindrop runs a temporary HTTP server on your device (default port 1130). On any other device on the same local network‚Äîbe it a phone, tablet, or computer‚Äîyou just open the URL shown in the terminal in a browser to access the shared content.
